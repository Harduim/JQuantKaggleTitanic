> Overview of How Kaggle’s Competitions Work
>  1. Join the Competition
> Read about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.
> 2. Get to Work
> Download the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Kernels (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.
> 3. Make a Submission
> Upload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.
> 4. Check the Leaderboard
> See how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard.
> 5. Improve Your Score
> Check out the discussion forum to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.
> Kaggle Lingo Video
> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out Dr. Rachael Tatman’s video on Kaggle Lingo to get up to speed!
> What Data Will I Use in This Competition?
> In this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.
> Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.
> The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.
> Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.
> Check out the “Data” tab to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model 
> stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.
